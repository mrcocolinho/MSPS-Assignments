    "We have seen that filtering is simply the selection of desired parts of the signal and the suppression of unwanted components. Thus far we have not only learnt how to characterise and design filters with desired spectral characteristics (low-pass, band-pass, notch, ...), but also how to design filters that are _adaptive_ (they change their characteritics automatically, depending on the input). In this lab session we will round off our journey into filter design by investigating certain practical aspects. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the _first_ part you will learn how numerical errors in representing filter coefficients can have unexpected consequences and you will see how to avoid such issues. In the _second_ part of the exercise we shall take a closer look at the phase response of filters. Thus far we have seen the phase response only in passing - the amplitude response was given more importance. However, not considering the phase response can have consequences for biomedical signal processing - as we shall see.\n",

    "The frequency response of a filter is determined by its poles and zeroes. By adjusting them - i.e. moving them in the Z-plane - different frequencies can be emphasised or attenuated. In our previous exercises, we always assumed that sufficient numerical accuracy was available to represent any pole or zero. What happens if the numerical accuracy is limited - which can happen in limited resource computing platforms (like the popular ARM controller)? The limited precision (limited number of bits) can end up _quantising_ the locations of the poles or zeros, rounding off their values. This leads to a shift of the implemented poles and zeroes away from the designed values. Let us see what the effect of this can be - and, rather surprisingly, we do not need to go to limited precision platforms to see this. Our own computers, with double precision arithmetic, can sometimes fail as well!\n",
